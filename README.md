## Project Goals

1- Translate the code to english so it can be more easylly read by everyone;

2- Refactor the code to meet best practices

3- Implement new features!

## Objectives

This repository was created with the objectives of improving and refactoring this old game we made back in 2016. I decided to do it because back there we were very proud of the results, but now, with some more baggage, I really can see a lot of room for improvement!
Also, I intend to apply some very useful content I'm learning from **[Refactoring](https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Existing-Addison-Wesley-Signature-ebook/dp/B07LCM8RG2/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=refactoring&qid=1587301828&sr=8-1)** and **[Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship-ebook/dp/B001GSTOAM/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=clean+code&qid=1587301853&sr=8-1)** books.
